Leapkit @ CBS - 11-02-2015:

Project:
Take LinkedIn login and scrape competencies and courses (info!)
Create matchmaking algorithm that can match students to projects based on the information scraped from LinkedIn.



Scrum:
We create demos for each sprint and meet up and show what we've done.



Client wishes:
Get the basics done well, for instance, algorithm speed is not the primary factor, better matching is more important.

Algorithm should rather show too many than too fwe projects, since the project pool is rather shallow right now.



Other stuff:
We get an image of a machine that can run the solution for testing.
