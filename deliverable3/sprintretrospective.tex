\section{Sprint Retrospective}
% what went well, what went less well, and what will you improve

We had a meeting with our partners early in the sprint. They approved of
our work in the previous sprint and our plans for this one. We requested
some database data from them and was promptly given a dump of their
database. So the partnership is working out very well.

We got ahead of our sprint goals early in the sprint, but also discovered
some new tasks like setting up a database for the LinkedIn data. We are
still ahead of our expectations, but we could have assigned more points to
this sprint. But due to exams and because we were ahead we decided to take
it a bit easier this sprint.

Last time we had not gotten our continuous integration up and running, but
now Jenkins is running smoothly and tests our build when we push to our
release branch.

We have gotten better at doing things the Scrum way. When we started the
sprint we assigned us to tasks and before we start our workday we quickly
go through the statuses of them. 

People have gotten better at meeting on time, but there is still ample
room for improvement. This means that in practice we start working before
the starting Scrum meeting, but we do this as soon as everybody has
arrived.
