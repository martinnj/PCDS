\section{Sprint Goal}

Figure \ref{fig:design} shows the software design we choose for our
project, and how the system interacts with the user. The yellow boxes
are the given sites and the green boxes is the databases of the sites.
The red User box represents the User actor. As of the start of the project
the Leapkit Frontend, Leapkit Projects, Leapkit Users are already implemented by 
our product owner.
This means the yellow and red boxes also represents our general architecture.
