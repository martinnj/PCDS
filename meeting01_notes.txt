Things from LinkedIn:
Their study/subject,
How far they are (BSc & MSc),
Interests,
Skills.

Graduateland ? - Other LinkedIn integration example.

Is it possible to make an admin page where you can manually match students and projects?

Createa a common versioning sytem so we can get updates from them, and the other way around. <------- THIS IS IMPORTANT! :D

(Crossover with other project/nice to have) - Possible to do notifications/comms when matches happen between persons/projects.?
Possible solution(still nice to have): When projects get generated, run matching with all users. Dump possible matches in a new table, once a week, run over the table and compile a project list for all users who got matched.
