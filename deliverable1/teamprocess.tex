\section{Team processes}

\subsection{Configuration management}

The report code will be stored on Github in a private repository, and will be
written in \LaTeX.

\todo[inline]{The rest is dependant on the internal workings of Leapkit.}

\subsection{Office rules}

We don't work in an office, but will rather be working primarily at DIKU and if
needed at the team members apartments. There will not be strict rules for the
use of phones or small procrastinations, it is frowned upon however to not help
the team reach the goals of the sprint.

\subsection{Calendar planning}

\todo[inline]{Do for real maybe :P}

         Complete goals   & All the time  & All over.
