\section{User/Customer}

The customer and product owner is the startup Leapkit, it consists of 5 CBS- and ex students. The facilitate matchmaking between companies and students in order to allow joint projects.

We have agreed to meet with them at least once per sprint to evaluate the last sprint and demonstrate the prototypes produced during the sprint. At the same meeting we will share our backlog and calibrate ``expectations'' making sure both the development team and the product owners expect the same for the upcoming sprint.

Leapkit have provided us with a virtual machine image of their web solution witch we can use for testing and integrate the new functions into.
