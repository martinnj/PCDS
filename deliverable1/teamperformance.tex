\section{Team Performance \& Progress Monitoring}

\subsection{Progress Monitoring}
The work-daily Scrum meetings shall monitor the progress of the sprint with regards to the sprint goal, i.e. completed backlog items and possibly changes to the backlog.

Each sprint shall result in a prototype with added/refined functionality, with respect to e.g. new features, performance, i.e. progress from previous prototype. It shall seek to fulfill the sprint goal.

Each sprint shall end with feedback from the product owner assessing the current prototype with respect to completeness, functionality and degree of fulfillment of the sprint goal. This is the Scrum Sprint Preview.

\subsection{Team Performance}
Each sprint end in a team review meeting, i.e. a Scrum Sprint Retrospective, where we discuss possible relational problems within the team itself, and assess how the sprint went. What went wrong and right and how can we do better next sprint.

In case of sudden team problems, these will be handled at the work-daily Scrum meetings.
