\section{Team empowerment}

We are using a SCRUM based work schedule, which gives each developer some degree of freedom while still allowing both the Scrum Master
and Product Owner some degree of control.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The team breaks down and estimates prioritised work items in the sprint backlog
    \item The team deligates tasks based on the estimation of workload and individual skills.
    \item Each team member individually plans and execute his own daily routine.
    \item Each team member plans their own daily work in respect for planned activities/meeting
    % \item Each team member is encouraged to work overtime, but his time will not be compensated.
    \item The team can propose a re-prioritising of the committed business deliveries 
\end{itemize}
