\section{Team empowerment}

We are using a Scrum based work schedule, which gives each developer some degree of freedom while still allowing both the Scrum Master
and Product Owner some degree of control.

The following is a list of thoughts on the empowerment of each team member and the way the team should work. The list is inspired by and contains entries from the examples given in the template.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The team breaks down and estimates prioritised work items in the sprint backlog.
    \item The team delegates tasks based on the estimation of workload and individual skills.
    \item Each team member individually plans and execute his own daily routine.
    \item Each team member plans their own daily work in respect for planned activities/meeting.
    \item The team can propose a re-prioritising of the committed business deliveries.
\end{itemize}
