\section{Sprint Goal}

%TODO Report on the sprint goal by describing your current development process and by discussing how and why you have improved/will improve the proces.

The developement process is roughly as follows. A set of tasks are created from a set of sprint goals, whereby the sprint goals are split into smaller, more concrete tasks, typically solvable by one or two developers. The tasks are then given a time frame using Scrum techniques such as planning poker, and afterwards assigned to the developers. This is done by the Scrum master via dialog and in agreement in the team. 

A task is then solved a developer (or a team of developer if needed), and the results are loosely presented to the rest of the team, so everybody is up to date on the current progress.
