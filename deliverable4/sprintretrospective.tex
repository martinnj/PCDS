\section{Sprint Retrospective}

As we can see in Figure \ref{fig:burndownSprint} on day 5 we did not complete
any points. This was not for lack of work but a symptom of some of our backlog
items being too encompassing. As part of the preperation for the next sprint we
should work on breaking down some of the larger tasks into smaller ones.
