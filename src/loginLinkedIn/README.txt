If you have setup the environment from the ../PCDS/src folder and sourced it, 
you can run the code:

python linkedin_connector.py
python linkedin_connector2.py

linkedin_connector.py: Example of redirection to loginportal and after login and redirection to set url, here www.leapkit.com along with extracting all information about user.

linkedin_connector2.py: Example of data extraction directly from my acc, only for initial testing.


Note that ONLY python2.7 works with the imported library python_linkedin.
The environment set default python to be python2.7.
