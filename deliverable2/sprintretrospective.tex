\section{Sprint Retrospective}
% what went well, what went less well, and what will you improve

We established a good connection to our project partners and a had a
couple of meetings where we met all of the company. We have firmly
established what the project is about and what it is not about. 

We managed to complete all of our first sprint, but it was a bit
lighter than intended.

We did not get around to actually rating the individual task before the
last part of the sprint. So it was fairly lucky that we did not mess up,
when we carried out the planned sprint. 

Jenkins got set up after we started programming and is not fully ready
for use, but by the start of the next sprint, we expect to have it
running.

We did not assign tasks to individual people in the group, but instead
people just did whichever task the felt like doing. In the future we will
assign them, so the workload is balanced among the group and we all know
what each of us is doing.

People have been bad at meeting at the agreed time, so we will try to
improve this. The fairly noticeable difference in peoples' arrival
time have caused our work schedules to become rather ad-hoc and our
Scrum-meetings sometimes never happen. This will definitely be changed in
the upcoming sprint.
