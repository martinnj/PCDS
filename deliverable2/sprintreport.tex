\subsection{Current Sprint}

The following stories was completed as planed at the start of the sprint:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create code that can connect to LinkedIn.
    \item Create a (simple, non-intergrated) login portal to let the user provide their linkedin credentials/API-key. 
    \item Create code that can extract information from LinkedIn.
    \item Create code that can translate extracted LinkedIn information into Leapkit information.
    \item Research matching methods for the algorithm.
\end{itemize}
We did not complete the story:
\begin{center}
    \emph{Create code that can save the translated LinkedIn data to the Leapkit Database.}
\end{center}
As we in the sprint discovered we needed more information about the database from our product owner.
The slowdown seen on our burndown chart \ref{fig:burndownSprint} is explained by us running into the problem
of installing and running the virtual machine that is needed for us to code on the project.\\

A general overview of the project can be seen on the general burndown chart \ref{fig:burndownProject}.\\
An interesting observation, is even if we did not complete everything we planed in the sprint, we did
end up completing a larger amount of points then we projected, as multiple new stories were discovered and solved
while we were working on the sprint. These includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Setup virtual enviroment 
    \item Setup version control
    \item Setup continuous integration
\end{itemize}
