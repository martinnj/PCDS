\section{Sprint Goal}
We have summerized the user stories on which all tasks have been based over all the sprints to be the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item As a user I want to be able to retrieve LinkedIn data to my Leapkit profile.
\item As a user I want to be able to verify my LinkedIn data has been recieved.
\item As a user I want to be able to view the retrieved LinkedIn data.
\item As a user I want to be able to get recommended projects based on my LinkedIn profile skills.
\item As a user I want to be able to update my retrieved LinkedIn data on Leapkit.
\item As an administrator I want to be able to view and handle (i.e. edit, delete, etc.) retrieved LinkedIn data of users.
\end{itemize}


Figure \ref{fig:profilesequence} shows an updated version of the sequence diagram from the previous sprint. It was missing the indication of a GUI-response on extraction of LinkedIn data.
