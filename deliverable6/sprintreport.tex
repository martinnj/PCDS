\subsection{Current Sprint}
Due to the LinkedIn API change last sprint, the project has hit a stand still, because the main functionality can no longer work. We made a simulator of the LinkedIn api such that the project can still be demoed, but in reality it no longer works and will not be able to. The LinkedIn API change was made to keep external sources from extracting LinkedIn data on the large scale format that this project was based on, thus eliminating the basis for the project.
