\section{Sprint Retrospective}

At the start of this sprint we were almost done. We needed to do the final
finetuning and integrate the solution. However when LinkedIn shut down
their API for public use, we were unable to finish the project. We
modified the project so we are able to demo it as it ought to have been,
but other than that, we have not performed work on the project.

We have had some contact with Leapkit. We have discussed a meeting to
evaluate the project, but they understands that the project is done for.
