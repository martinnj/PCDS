\section{Sprint Retrospective}

We have had some issues getting the entire group together for workdays due to a
mix of work, personal matters and DIKU social events. Thus we have had very few
full work day. For the next sprint we will try to plan our work days better so
there is less conflicts with other events.

During earlier sprints we have done workdaily standup-meetings to ensure that
everybody was up to data and knew what to do, but as the doable tasks have grown
fewer, this has also become less structured as people quickly do whatever seems
like the next thing. All the remaining tasks have very few points assigned to
them and there are not many left, so things have gotten very relaxed.

The product owners have conflicting ideas of how to do the matchmaking and how
to show the results on the project page. We are trying to conform to their
decisions, but it has caused a few issues. In addition they promised to create a
design for showing information on the profile page which we could implement, but
we have yet to receive it, so it remans in an prototype state. Finally we have
yet to plan a date for our next meeting and it is unlikely that it will be in
the beginning of the final sprint, so hopefully we should be able to hand over
an integrated solution by the time we meet.
