Matching methods:

Top level matching:
Companies select one or more fields that the project covers.
This gets matched to the students "major".
Any match returned.

Skill-based matching:
We collate a skill DB based on skills scraped from student profiles.
When creating projects, companies can chose some skills to attach to the project.
We count number of matches between a student and a project. BAM!


Text-based matching:
Find occurences of the students "skills"[0] in the body of the project text and count number of occurences. Minimum length of substrings can be adjusted.
[0]skills can be multible word things like "system management", match on the entire thing, and "system" and "management". Might return too many positives. can be adjusted.


Normalize all above:
Find a way to normalize each of the above to a value between 0 and 1. Add them,
and rank accordingly.
