Matching methods:

General approach:
Return as many results as possible, consider even returning all projects in a 
sorted order with regards to matching degree.



Skill-based matching:
We collate a skill DB based on skills scraped from student profiles. When
creating projects, companies can chose some skills to attach to the project. 
The number of matches determines the matching degree.


Text-based matching: 
Find occurences of the students "skills"[0] in the body
of the project text and count number of occurences. Minimum length of substrings
can be adjusted. [0]skills can be multible word things like "system management",
match on the entire thing, and "system" and "management". Might return too many
positives. can be adjusted.


Top level matching:
Companies select one or more fields that the project covers.
This gets matched to the students "major".
Any match returned.
PROBLEMS:
Does apply to general approach, but may be an addition to other matching methods.


Normalize all above:
Find a way to normalize each of the above to a value between 0 and 1. Add them,
and rank accordingly.
Wright the different match types so the priorities can be adjusted.
